## THE 5 AUCTION TYPES

### A. OPEN AUCTION
All players (including auctioneer) can bid in any order, any number of times.
Simply state bid amount out loud. Auctioneer keeps track.
Ends when no one wants to bid higher.
If no bids, auctioneer gets painting for free.

### B. ONE OFFER AUCTION
Starting left of auctioneer, moving clockwise, each player may:
- Pass (not bid)
- Bid an amount higher than previous bid
Auctioneer has last chance to bid.
After auctioneer bids or passes, auction ends.
If no bids, auctioneer gets painting for free.

### C. HIDDEN AUCTION (SEALED)
All players simultaneously make one secret bid.
Choose amount, secretly put money in closed fist.
If no bid, hold out empty fist.
Everyone reveals at same time.
Highest bidder wins. Ties: player closest to auctioneer clockwise wins.
If no bids, auctioneer gets painting for free.

### D. FIXED PRICE AUCTION
Auctioneer chooses a price and announces it.
Starting left of auctioneer, moving clockwise, each player can:
- Buy at this price (auction ends immediately)
- Pass
If no one buys, auctioneer MUST buy it for the fixed price.
Auctioneer cannot declare price higher than they have.

### E. DOUBLE AUCTION
1) If auctioneer plays Double Auction card, they may offer a second painting of same artist (but not another Double).
   Both paintings auctioned together using auction type on second card.
   Winner buys both paintings.

2) If auctioneer doesn't play second card (or cannot):
   - Player to left has opportunity to play second painting of same artist
   - If they don't/cannot, each player clockwise has opportunity
   - If no one plays second painting, auctioneer gets original for free

   BUT if another player plays second painting:
   - That player becomes NEW auctioneer
   - They auction both cards using type on second card
   - Highest bidder buys both, new auctioneer gets ALL money
   - Play continues with player to left of NEW auctioneer
   - Players between original and new auctioneer lose their turn

## ENDING THE AUCTION ROUND
Keep track of paintings sold for each artist.
When 5th painting of ANY artist is played, round ends immediately.
- The 5th painting is NOT auctioned, not owned by anyone
- If 5th painting is second painting of Double, TWO unsold paintings
- If 5th is first painting of Double, round ends, no second played
- Players keep remaining cards for future rounds

## SELLING TO THE BANK
1. Count paintings sold for each artist (include unsold 5th paintings)

2. Rank top 3 artists by sales count:
   - First: 30k
   - Second: 20k
   - Third: 10k
   - All others: nothing

   Tiebreaker: Artist closer to left of board (closest to Manuel) ranks higher

3. Place value tiles on board (one row per round). Tiles remain for entire game.

4. All players sell ALL paintings they purchased this round at current artist value.
   Even if worth nothing, must sell.

5. After selling, discard all paintings from round (ownership never carries over).
   Cards in hands NOT discarded.

## CARD DEALING FOR EACH ROUND
| Players | Round 1 | Round 2 | Round 3 | Round 4 |

New cards added to any cards remaining in hands.
Play continues with player to left of auctioneer who played last painting.

## VALUE ACCUMULATION
Artist values accumulate across rounds!
When artist places in top 3, add value tile.
Paintings worth SUM of all tiles in that artist's column.

Example: Rafael Silveira
- Round 1: 1st place (30k tile). Worth 30k each.
- Round 2: 3rd place (10k tile). Worth 40k each (30+10).
- Round 3: Not in top 3. Worth 0k this round, but still has 30k+10k tiles.
- Round 4: 2nd place (20k tile). Worth 60k each! (30+10+20)

## RUNNING OUT OF CARDS
If player runs out during round, cannot auction until new cards dealt.
May still bid on others' paintings.

If ALL players run out before end of Round 4:
- Round ends when final card played
- Final painting not auctioned, but counts for totals
- Determine artist values, pay for paintings owned
- Game ends

## WINNING
When 4th round ends and all paintings sold, player with most money wins!

## 3 PLAYER VARIANT: THE MYSTERY PLAYER
Deal cards as if 4 players, keep one hand face down (mystery hand).
After normal auction from your hand, may flip random card from mystery hand (optional).
Mystery painting not auctioned, doesn't belong to anyone, but counts for round total.
If mystery painting is 5th for artist, round ends.
If Double, no second card played.
After selling at end of round, mystery paintings discarded with others.
